      "🔎 QUESTION 1: What are the primary risk factors identified for the fiscal year 2025?\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 ANSWER:\n",
      "The primary risk factor identified for the fiscal year 2025 is interest rate risk. According to the provided context, the Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, which can negatively affect the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company's term debt. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the context mentions that the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios to protect against interest rate risk. However, the context does not provide a detailed table or specific numbers regarding the potential impacts on the Company's investment portfolio and term debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also worth noting that the context mentions a section on \"Risk Factors\" (Item 1A) which summarizes factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. However, the provided context does not give a detailed list of these risk factors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the provided context, the primary risk factor identified for the fiscal year 2025 is interest rate risk, but it is recommended to review the entire 10-K filing to get a comprehensive understanding of all the risk factors associated with the Company.\n",

      "🔎 QUESTION 2: How much did Apple invest in Research and Development?\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 ANSWER:\n",
      "The provided context does not explicitly mention the amount Apple invested in Research and Development. However, it does mention that the company is involved in \"hardware, software and service research, development, design and marketing\" and that it has accumulated a large portfolio of intellectual property rights. To find the exact amount invested in Research and Development, we would need to look at the financial statements or other relevant sections of the 10-K filing, which are not provided in the given context.\n",

      "🔎 QUESTION 3: What does the report say about the impact of Artificial Intelligence on future products?\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 ANSWER:\n",
      "The report highlights several potential risks and challenges associated with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the company's future products. Specifically, it mentions that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as AI features, can increase safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate, or other negative content and experiences.\n",
      "2. The use of AI can involve the acquisition and use of copyrighted materials for training, as well as the potential reproduction of copyrighted materials in their outputs, which may lead to intellectual property infringement claims.\n",
      "3. The company may not be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the AI-powered hardware, software, and services it offers, which can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company's products and services.\n",
      "4. Errors, bugs, and vulnerabilities in AI-powered systems can be exploited by third parties, compromising the security and integrity of the company's products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the report suggests that the integration of AI into the company's products and services may pose significant risks and challenges, including intellectual property, safety, security, and regulatory risks, which could materially adversely affect the company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\n",
